# Complex_Networks


A set of programs for demonstrating the generation of networks using the Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogats and Barabashi-Albert models. 
It also includes HITS and Girvan - Newman Algorightms.

Dependencies (last versions of):
1) Tkinter 
2) Matplotlib
3) Networkx

Program Guide:

If you want to generate net:
  Parameter n is amount of verticies
  Parameter p is probability
  Parameter m is amount of verticies of new node with already existed
  Parameter k is amount of nearest neighbours to vertex v

If you want to check GN algorithm:
  First, choose working mode then program will generate random graph and execute GN algorithm. 
  Results will be showed in console/terminal
  
If you want to check HITS algorithms:
  Program will generate the net and then execute HITS algorithm
  then you will get result in console/terminal
